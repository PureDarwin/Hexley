# Statement on the Use of the Hexley Darwin Mascot Figure:

The Hexley Mascot is copyrighted by Jon Hooper. Usage of the mascot is permitted under the terms described below.

Individuals may use the daemon for their personal use within the bounds of good taste.

When reasonably possible, I would like the text "Hexley DarwinOS Mascot Copyright 2000 by Jon Hooper. All Rights Reserved." to be included.

This text need not be etched into the figure or garishly displayed when using the mascot as say an Icon in a web frame. A good example of how to handle the due credit in a web page is to create a link from the mascot picture to the following text:

Hexley DarwinOS Mascot Copyright 2000 by Jon Hooper
All Rights Reserved.

If you want to mass produce the mascot on T-shirts, CDROM's, etc you need to request permission in advance. In general, I require that the mascot be used in an appropriate way. This means that it has to be something related to DarwinOS and not expropriated as a company logo (though I will allow companies with Darwin-based products to use it). If you are just using the logo on a T-Shirt for a few friends or team members you don't have to request permission.

Permission to use the mascot may be obtained from:
Jon Hooper via email

The only other restriction on the use of the logo is that I would prefer that the original designs be the ones that you use in order that the quality of the logo is not diluted.
